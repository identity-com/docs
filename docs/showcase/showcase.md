# Identity Technology Showcase

This guide will take you through the suite of Identity software available on Solana.

## Setup

For this demo you'll need the following setup on your machine:
- Node 14+
- `yarn`
- Solana Tool Suite (1.8.0+)
- @identity.com/sol-did-client
- @identity.com/cryptid-cli
- @identity.com/solana-gatekeeper-lib

For demo purposes we will use the `node:16` docker image that comes with `node` and `yarn` 
and install all relevant software inside this dedicated environment

```shell
$ docker run -it node:16 /bin/bash
```

### Solana
The Solana Tool Suite will allow you to interact with Solana via the cli.  

```shell
# Install the Solana tool suite
$ sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.8.1/install)"

# Export the given path (or and add it to .profile (or equivalent for your shell)) e.g.
$ export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"

# Check that Solana is installed and accessible
$ solana --version

# Setup a new key-pair for the demo
$ solana-keygen new

# We do this demo in Devnet
$ solana config set -u devnet
```

### SOL DID Client
The SOL DID client allows you to manage DID documents on Solana.

```shell
$ yarn global add @identity.com/sol-did-client
```

### Cryptid Client
The Cryptid client allows you to manage your Cryptid account on the cli.

[See here](https://github.com/identity-com/cryptid) for more information on Cryptid.

```shell
$ yarn global add @identity.com/cryptid-cli

$ cryptid --help
```

### Gateway Client
The gateway client allows the management of "Gateway Tokens". A gateway token is required for a user to prove that they have
been verified by a gatekeeper before being allowed to use certain on-chain applications. The rules required for a 
gatekeeper to issue a token could include things like age checks, OFAC checks, etc.

More information can be found [here](https://identity-com.github.io/on-chain-identity-gateway).

```shell
$ yarn global add @identity.com/solana-gatekeeper-lib

$ gateway --help
```

## Getting started with did:sol

Here we show how to display your Solana address using the Solana client, and displaying your DID document
using the [sol-did](https://github.com/identity-com/sol-did) cli.

You can follow the steps below and follow along on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4vYa0uxYcs

```shell
# Display your Solana address
$ solana address

# A DID is automatically derived from any solana public key. Display the DID document.
$ sol did:sol:devnet:$(solana address)
```

Visit [https://did.civic.com](https://did.civic.com) and resolve the above DID using the Universal Resolver.

## Manipulating SOL DIDs

Below is an introduction to [Cryptid](https://github.com/identity-com/cryptid), a tool for manipulating DID
documents on Solana. In this example, we will demonstrate key rotation using the Cryptid CLI tool by:

* adding an additional key to your DID
* removing your original key (e.g. if it has been compromised)
* retaining access to your Cryptid account via the additional key

You can go through the steps below and follow along on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Oo11qy7ug

```shell
# Initialize Cryptid configuration (using your Solana key by default)
$ cryptid init

# View the Cryptid configuration
$ cryptid config

# View your DID document
$ cryptid document

# Airdop SOL to the signing key and Cryptid account (so that we can add additional keys to our account)
$ cryptid airdrop

# Generate a new Solana key
$ solana-keygen new -o key2.json

# Add the new public key to your Cryptid account, with 'key2' as an alias
$ cryptid key add <pubkey> key2

# Transfer SOL to the new key
$ cryptid transfer <pubkey> 1000000

# View the updated DID document (with the additional key added)
$ cryptid document

# Update Cryptid configuration to use the new key by default
$ cryptid config set keyFile $(pwd)/key2.json

# Remove the default key
$ cryptid key remove default

# Check the updated DID document
$ cryptid document

# Update Cryptid configuration to use the original (default) key
$ cryptid config set keyFile $HOME/.config/solana/id.json

# Expect transfer of using the removed key to fail
$ cryptid transfer <pubkey> 1000000

# Switch back to your new key
$ cryptid config set keyFile $(pwd)/key2.json
```

## Controllers

Here we show how you can use [Cryptid](https://github.com/identity-com/cryptid) to setup one DID to be a controller of 
another DID. For example, if a DID represents a business in the real world, the CEO's DID can be setup as a 
controller of the business. This will allow the CEO to sign as that business using their own keys.

You can go through the steps below and follow along on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oSTRnvnmNM

```shell
# Create a key from which a new DID will be derived. We will be using this DID for the account we are going to control.
$ solana-keygen new -o controlled.json

# Create a Cryptid configuration for the new DID, called `controlled.yml` for the account we are going to control.
$ cryptid init -k controlled.json -p controlled.yml

# Check the configuration. With the `-c controlled.yml` you are instructing Cryptid to use the config of the new DID
# instead of the config at `$HOME/.config/cryptid/config.yml`
$ cryptid config -c controlled.yml

# Fund the new DID's Cryptid account so that we can add the controller DID to it
$ cryptid transfer <NEW_DID> 100000000

# Fund the #default signer
$ cryptid transfer <pubkey controlled.json> 100000000

# Add your main account as a controller of the new DID 
$ cryptid controller add -c controlled.yml <OLD_DID>

# Add an alias for the controlled did (for convenience)
$ cryptid alias controlled <NEW_DID>

# Add an alias for your original did (for convenience)
$ cryptid alias me <OLD_DID>

# Check the DID document for the controlled Cryptid account. 
# By using `--as controlled`, we are instructing Cryptid to perform actions using your default DID while controlling
# the `controlled` DID.
$ cryptid document --as controlled

# Check the balance for the controlled Cryptid account
$ cryptid balance --as controlled

# Perform a transfer transaction from the controlled account, signing with the default account.
$ cryptid transfer me 10000 --as controlled
```

## Cryptid Wallet UI

We can achieve the same controller relationship as above, by adding our Cryptid UI wallet as a controller to the account
created above.

- Visit [http://cryptid.identity.com](http://cryptid.identity.com)
- Create a new Cryptid account by connecting a wallet
- Airdrop using UI

```shell
# Add your UI did as a controller to your CLI account
$ cryptid controller add -c controlled.yml <UI_DID>
```

- Add controlled DID to UI
- Transfer 0.1 from controlled to UI Cryptid account

## Gateway

Here we will show how to issue a gateway token to a Cryptid address from a public dummy gatekeeper. 
This example will show how you cannot mint a NFT until a gateway token has been issued.

You can go through the steps below and follow along on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oSTRnvnmNM

Visit [http://candy.identity.com](http://candy.identity.com) and notice that you cannot yet mint an NFT.

```shell
# Issue a gateway token to your Cryptid address
$ gateway issue -g $HOME/.config/solana/id.json -c devnet <CONTROLLED CRYPTID ADDRESS>
```

Visit [http://candy.identity.com](http://candy.identity.com) again, and notice that you can now mint an NFT.

## Credentials & Gateway

Here is an end-to-end showcase to show a "real life" example of a gateway token issuance based on credentials. This will
show how you cannot mint and NFT until you've gone through a Civic KYC process, signed the credentials with Cryptid
and issued a gateway token to your Cryptid account.

Identity.com are partnered with Civic, and the Civic KYC process is used in the demo application. It is not a 
pre-requisite for receiving a gateway token.

You can go through the steps below and follow along on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Oo11qy7ug

- Go to [http://candy.identity.com](http://candy.identity.com) (and fail to mint an NFT)
- Visit [https://vp-demo.identity.com](https://vp-demo.identity.com)
- Connect Cryptid wallet
- Scan QR code and onboard with Civic
- Sign credential with the Cryptid key
- Click button to get Gateway Token issued to your Cryptid account
- Mint NFT [http://candy.identity.com](http://candy.identity.com)
