# Guardian

Guardians are entities that approve and regularly audit Gatekeepers to make sure that Gatekeepers are maintaining proper records, accurately verifying whether a user qualifies for a Gateway Pass or not, and revoking users that fail KYC/AML standards of their country of residence. Guardians make sure that all entities involved are working in the best interests of the Gateway Protocol.
