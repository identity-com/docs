# Governance

The Gateway Protocol is governed by a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) - still to be launched. This organization, in turn, is governed by the governance token holders and active Gatekeepers. Currently, Identity.com serves as the Guardian, but the goal is to decentralize governance via a DAO in the future.

Each Gatekeeper is required to stake an amount of the Gateway Protocol governance token based on their expected activity on the network. Governance tokens holders can propose changes and vote on Guardians, protocol changes, upgrades, and future developments of the Gateway Protocol. 

## Purpose of Governance

The purpose of governance is to perform the following tasks:
* Align incentives and give Gatekeepers a vested interest in the Gateway Protocol
* Enhance the Gateway Protocol through Gateway Protocol Improvements (GPI)
* Set up new Gatekeeper Networks
* Vote on Guardians

## Governance voting

Voters are:
* Governance token holders (including Gatekeepers)
* Gateway Pass holders

Voting power is determined by the amount of tokens the governor holds, the length of time the tokens have been held, and the constraints of the Gateway Pass.
