# Gatekeepers

A Gatekeeper is an identity verifier of the Gatekeeper Network.

## How to become a Gatekeeper

To become a Gatekeeper, an organization must complete the following steps.

1. Make sure that a user can be successfully verified in accordance with the requirements of the Gatekeeper Network.
1. Apply to join the Gatekeeper Network.
1. Complete an audit by the Guardian. The Guardian verifies that the prospective Gatekeeper can perform necessary tasks. This audit could be completed by a third party authorized by the Guardian instead. The Gatekeeper pays for the audit.
1. Stake the minimum amount of Governance tokens. This amount is determined by the expected volume and types of verifications of Gateway Pass transactions.

To protect users data, Gatekeepers are required to make sure verification data is private and protected, and that no personal information is made public.

## Gateway Protocol Monetization

Gatekeepers are monetized through payments made on their managed dApps or during Gateway Pass Read and Write operations. Gatekeepers are either paid in the token of the Gateway network (e.g. SOL), or in the tokens of the blockchain used for payments (e.g. USDC).
