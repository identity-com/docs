# Overview

The Gateway Protocol is a cross-chain oracle protocol that allows decentralized apps (dApps) to complete identity verification in order to meet identity requirements, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML), age, location, etc. without developing the entire solution. Instead, a dApp requires the wallet to contain a specific and active Gateway Pass from a chosen Gatekeeper Network.

The identity verification process is completed by one or more Gatekeepers in a Gatekeeper Network. The Gatekeepers enforce the predetermined requirements and issue a Gateway Pass once the user successfully completes the verification.

The Gateway Pass then allows the user to interact with the dApp without any further interaction without further verification prompts.

# High-Level Motivation

In a soon to be regulated world, dApps will need to comply with KYC/AML and other identity requirements. This is a huge burden for dApps to take on, and it is not in their best interest to do so. Hence, the Gateway Protocol was built. 

Instead, dApps should be able to rely on a third party to verify the identity of users and issue a Gateway Pass that allows the user to interact with the dApp without further verification prompts. This is the role of Gatekeepers.
