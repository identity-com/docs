# Overview

The Gateway Protocol is a cross-chain oracle protocol that allows decentralized apps (dApps) to complete identity verification in order to meet identity requirements, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML), age, location, etc. without developing the entire solution. Instead, a dApp requires the wallet to contain a specific and active Gateway Pass from a chosen Gatekeeper Network.

The identity verification process is completed by one or more Gatekeepers in a Gatekeeper Network. The Gatekeepers enforce the predetermined requirements and issue a Gateway Pass once the user successfully completes the verification.

The Gateway Pass then allows the user to interact with the dApp without any further interaction without further verification prompts.
