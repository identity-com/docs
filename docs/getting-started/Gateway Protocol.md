# How do I start with Gateway Protocl after I installed it?

Once we have installed Gateway Protocol, there are two things we can do. 

1. use of OFF-CHAIN GATEKEEPER: This is a Standard Use Case of creating a Network and having an EXTERNAL Gatekeeper as trusted issuer.

TODO: Good “Story”. KYC, Carbon Utilization, Bot Protection… Include Payment Flows

2. use of ON-CHAIN GATEKEEPER: Here on-chain program is the Gatekeeper / Gatekeeper Network

TODO: Story with On-Chain program as a Gatekeeper., DID-state (e.g. you have at least one ETH key linked). You are part of a DAO with XYZ contributions.
